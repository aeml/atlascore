# ASCII Renderer Module

The `ascii` module provides lightweight text-based visualization.

- `Renderer`: outputs textual frames. Currently supports:
	- `Render` (world stub)
	- `RenderBodies` for lists of `TransformComponent` / `RigidBodyComponent`, used in the falling-body demo.

Future enhancements will include formatting tweaks, optional bounding box display, and integration with ECS queries.
